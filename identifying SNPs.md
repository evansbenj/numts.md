# Identifying SNPs in mtDNA

I wrote a script that identifies SNPs in an aligned fasta file.  It allows me to vary how many individuals are compared to others in an alignment. For starters I'm doing Sima plus 4 denis compared to humans and neanders.

This script also executes another script that queries a jellyfish file and quantifies kmers.
